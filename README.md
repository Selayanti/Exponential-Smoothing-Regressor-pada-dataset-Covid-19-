# COVID-19 Case Forecasting using Exponential Smoothing Technique
This project aims to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases using the Exponential Smoothing technique. By analyzing historical daily case data, the project implements a time series forecasting model to predict future case numbers and evaluate the model's performance.

# Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, and accurate forecasting of case numbers is crucial for effective planning and resource allocation. In this project, the Exponential Smoothing method is employed to develop a forecasting model using Python and its data analysis libraries.

# Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning, formatting, and conversion to ensure data quality.
- Exponential Smoothing Implementation: Applies the Exponential Smoothing technique to forecast future COVID-19 case numbers based on historical data.
- Parameter Optimization: Determines the optimal alpha (Î±) parameter value for the Exponential Smoothing model to achieve the best forecasting performance.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluates the forecasting model's accuracy using statistical metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
- Data Visualization: Generates visualizations to compare actual and forecasted case numbers, as well as control charts for monitoring process stability.
- Quality Control: Implements control charts with Upper Control Limit (UCL) and Lower Control Limit (LCL) calculations to monitor the forecasting process stability.
